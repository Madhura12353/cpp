To convert any base number to decimal, I ask user to input a number along with its current base.
Then I mutiply each digit with the correct power of input base and add the result. 
The power of input base is decided based onthe position of a digit. 
The digit at unit's place is multiplied by  basenumber to the power of zero,
 the digit at tens place is multiplied by basenumberto the power of one,
 the digit at hundread's place is mutiplied by basenumberto  to the power of two and so on 
until all the digits of the input number are covered. Then result of each multiplication is added and result is displayed.
